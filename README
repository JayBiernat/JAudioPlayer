JAudioPlayer

Author: Jay Biernat

A personal project currently in progress to create a
simple audio player using PortAudio (and eventually)
SDL.

This is an exercise to improve programming skills in
handling audio files and creating a GUI.  Currently
an audio player object is created, plays a sine wave
for five seconds, and then is stopped and destroyed.
