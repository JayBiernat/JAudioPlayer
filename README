JAudioPlayer

Author: Jay Biernat

A personal project currently in progress to create a
simple audio player using PortAudio and SDL.

This is an exercise to improve programming skills in
handling audio files and creating a GUI.  

Currently an audio player is created with placeholder
GUI.  A sinewave is played, and using keyboard input
the user can play and stop the sine wave, and quit
the audio player.
