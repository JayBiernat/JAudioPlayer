JAudioPlayer

Author: Jay Biernat

A personal project currently in progress to create a
simple audio player using:
	- PortAudio for audio stream handling
	- SDL for GUI creation
	- libsndfile for audio file input

This is an exercise to improve programming skills in
handling audio files and creating a GUI.  

Currently, the audio file to be played is specified
as a command line argument, and then playing/pausing/
quiting the audio player is handled  by the GUI.
