Pre-compiled binaries available with the J Audio Player release were
compiled with gcc version 4.8.1 (GCC) on Windows 7

To compile on Windows, the following libraries need to be installed
(the specified version or a version compatible with the specified major
release).

  - PortAudio V19  (http://www.portaudio.com/download.html)
  - SDL v2.0.4  (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
  - libsndfile v1.0.27  (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download)

*Note: Even if you are using a 64-bit machine, you will want to download
and link against the 32-bit versions of the libraries.

The source files for J Audio Player and assets can be downloaded from
GitHub:
  https://github.com/JayBiernat/JAudioPlayer

With the include and lib folders of the libraries added into gcc's search
path or passed to the compiler with appropriate -I and -L flags, execute
the following commands to compile:

gcc -Wall -O2 -I"Path\to\SDL\header" -I"Path\to\portaudio\header" -I"Path\to\libsndfile\header" -c JAudioPlayer.c JAudioPlayer.o

gcc -Wall -O2 -I"Path\to\SDL\header" -I"Path\to\portaudio\header" -I"Path\to\libsndfile\header" -c JPlayerGUI.c JPlayerGUI.o

gcc -Wall -O2 -I"Path\to\SDL\header" -I"Path\to\portaudio\header" -I"Path\to\libsndfile\header" -c main.c main.o

gcc -Wall -L"Path\to\SDL\library" -I"Path\to\portaudio\library" -I"Path\to\libsndfile\library" -o JAudioPlayer.exe main.o JAudioPlayer.o JPlayerGUI.o -lportaudio -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lsndfile-1 -s

TODO:  Add information about compiling on Linux, add
a makefile?
